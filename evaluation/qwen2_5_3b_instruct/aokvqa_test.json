This behavior is rooted in their evolutionary history, where finding a warm place to rest was crucial for survival. Cats have a natural preference for warm spots, such as under furniture, on blankets, or near heat sources like radiators or fireplaces.

Additionally, cats often seek out these warm spots to relax and conserve energy, as it allows them to conserve body heat and maintain their body temperature."
